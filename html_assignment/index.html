            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my lovely little web page! My name's Jessica, but like the title says, I prefer Jess! Less of a mouthful and not as <em>fancy sounding.</em> It suits me a lot better. I've been in Ottawa for my entire life; born and raised ever since the 8<sup>th</sup> of December, in the lovely year of 2004! Growing up, I was always coined to be the <em>creative</em> kid. Whether it be with my family, friends or peers at school. I think my interest in art was in due part of my curiousity and desire to explore. In fact, for my entire life, I had always wished to have been born in a city like Toronto where exploring would feel endless.

               Growing up with that title, it wasn't the least expected that I would end up trying numerous different creative hobbies. In all honesty, I was surprised that my family was supportive of my interests. Coming from an immigrant family, I had always expected to be pressured to do something more academic. Instead, I actually felt more pressure to become a <em>successful artist</em> if anything. While being an artist was once a dream, I grew frustrated and realized I wanted to be someone with multiple tricks up my sleeve instead. I wasn't content with pushing myself to learn only how to draw. It's why I decided to pursue <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> when I began dabbling with video editing during the lockdown. The lockdown gave me the chance to discover a lot about myself. Though times were tough, I felt as if it was an opportunity for many. Sometimes, time feels like it passes by way too fast and there's too much to do in the little amount of time we have. Without that momentary pause in the world, I don't think I would have gotten myself together and realized what I could have <em>made the time,</em> when there was too much of it then.
